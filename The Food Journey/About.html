<h1>I got insperation for this project because of my love of food! Since I was young I have always loved food making it and tasting it and that is what inspired me to make a website about food recipies from different countries.
</br>
<br>
Coder Series is the absolute best place to learn how to make a website and I highly recommend this for any young or old person interested in code.I am looking forward to future classes.

Go check out her website about Performing Arts, but finish looking at mine first. I really hope you enjoy my website and tell your friends.
